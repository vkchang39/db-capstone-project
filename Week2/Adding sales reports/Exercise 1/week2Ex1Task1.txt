check the model and query in main folder, you can find view query in that.

here is it too if you feel lazy:

CREATE VIEW `OrdersView` AS
SELECT
  o.`id` AS `order_id`,
  oi.`quantity`,
  (oi.`quantity` * m.`price`) AS `cost`
FROM
  `LittleLemonDB`.`orders` o
JOIN
  `LittleLemonDB`.`order_item` oi ON o.`id` = oi.`orders_id`
JOIN
  `LittleLemonDB`.`menu` m ON oi.`menu_id` = m.`id`
WHERE
  oi.`quantity` > 2;
